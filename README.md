# Cell-Image-Segmentation
The main task is to inspect and draw the membrane of the cell in the microscopy image.

It was a competition held by biendata, so we worked out the problem based on the champion's plan.

There are two tracks, namely simple track and complex track, in the competition. We applied LinkNet-34 with Leaky-Relu to complex track and got the highest score among students who chose the complex track.

However, we failed to use the second-stage LinkNet to potentially improve the performance.
